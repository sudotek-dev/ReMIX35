# ReMIX35

**ReMIX35** is an open-source upgrade kit that brings the MK3.5 features to **Prusa MK3S and MK3S+** printers, as well as high-quality clones.  
It is designed as a drop-in replacement for the Einsy RAMBo board, making the installation simple and non-invasive — no rewiring or complex teardown required.  

This repository provides documentation, design files, and other resources related to the project. Since ReMIX35 is still under active development, expect changes as prototypes are tested and refined.
